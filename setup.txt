Step 1: Gatherin' What Ya Need

First off, make sure ya got everything ya need:
- A computer, oh yah, and it should be a decent one.
- Internet connection – gotta be good and steady, like a Minnesota winter.
- Python installed – that’s what runs the whole shebang.
- Discord account and a bot token – you'll be needing this for sending those game updates.

Step 2: Gettin' Your Python Ready

Now, don'tcha know, you gotta install some Python packages. Open up your terminal or command prompt and type these in, one by one:

pip install discord.py
pip install nba_api
pip install python-dateutil

That'll get all the Python stuff you need, sure as hotdish at a potluck.

Step 3: Settin' Up Your Discord Bot

Oofda, this part's important:
- Head on over to the Discord Developer Portal.
- Create a new bot – give it a nice name, maybe somethin' sporty.
- Copy the bot token – but keep it secret, keep it safe!

Step 4: Pluggin' In Your Bot Token

Open up the Python script you just got all spiffed up:
- Find the line at the bottom that says `client.run('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN')`.
- Replace `'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'` with the actual token ya got from Discord, sure thing.

Step 5: Runnin' Your Bot

Alright, you betcha, time to run it:
- Go back to your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to where your script is saved.
- Type `python your_script_name.py` and hit Enter.

Step 6: Enjoy, Ya Got It!

Now, if all's done right, your bot should be up and runnin' faster than a snowmobile on a frozen lake. It'll be sendin' NBA game updates right to your Discord server. Grab a pop and enjoy the game, dontcha know!

Step 7: Running the NBA Score Tracker with start.sh (optional)

he start.sh script provides a hassle-free way to launch and manage your NBA Score Tracker directly from the command line. Just follow these simple steps to get started:

Prepare Your Scripts: Ensure that both the start.sh script and the nba.py script are saved in the same directory on your computer.

Access the Terminal: Open the terminal on your system.

Navigate to Your Script: Change your current directory to where your scripts are located. Use the cd command, like so: cd path/to/your/scripts.

Make the Script Executable: If you haven't already, you need to grant execution permissions to the start.sh script. Type chmod +x start.sh and hit Enter.

Launch the Script: Now, execute the script by typing ./start.sh in your terminal and pressing Enter.

Graceful Interruption: Should you need to stop the tracker, simply press Ctrl+C. The start.sh script is designed to ensure a smooth and clean termination of both the shell and the Python script.

And there you go! Enjoy tracking NBA scores in real time, right from your terminal.
